sdl-game
========

A simple game I've been playing around with to learn how to use the Control.Lenses library.
Not really much of a "game" but a fun start.

Install
=======
    git clone git@github.com:AtticHacker/sdl-game
    cd sdl-game
    cabal install --only-dependencies
    cabal configure ; cabal build
    
Run the game
============
    ./dist/build/project-end/project-end
